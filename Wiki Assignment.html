<h2 id="plot">Plot</h2><hr>
<p>Arjun Reddy's (Vijay Deverakonda) breakup pushes him to the verge of breaking down.

The story begins with Arjun practicing medicine in Hyderabad. Despite being high-functioning doctor he is in a lot of pain and using various coping mechanisms, such as abusing drugs, attempting one night stands and alcohol to deal with the pain.

A flashback reveals his past. Arjun is a final year student/house surgeon at a medical school in Mangalore. Despite being a brilliant student, he gets into trouble because of his inability to control his anger. He is also very aggressive which doesn't help his cause. He had a great group of friends, including Shiva, who constantly looks out for him.

4 years ago Arjun falls in love with a fresher/first year student, Preethi Shetty. He goes around campus asserting that this girl is now exclusive to him.He starts showering Preethi with his idea of love and affection, going so far as to even set her up with a fat friend, because he is of the opinion that "a fat chick and a cute chick is an awesome combination". Eventually Preethi reciprocates and they fall head long into an intense physical relationship. Two months later, she moves in with Arjun, to the house he and his friends have rented. They have a beautiful relationship till Arjun gets his MBBS degree. Then, he clears post-medical exams to get admitted for MS. Orthopaedics in Mussorie. He moves to Mussorie and the duo often fly to meet each other. Over a course of 3 years their relationship becomes stronger, and Preethi enters Final year as House surgeon. Arjun and Preethi don't meet for six months when Arjun is taking his Final exams. Then, he goes to Preethi's house to invite her over to function. They cuddle together and make out on her balcony, when her father walks in. Enraged, he throws Arjun out of the house.

Preethi's father opposes their relationship as they belong to different castes. Arjun delivers an ultimatum to Preethi that if she doesn't make a decision within 6 hours, their relationship is over. Following this incident, Preethi's phone is seized by her parents as to have no way to contact Arjun. When she finally comes to his house, he doesn't open the door to her as he's self injected himself with drugs and has gone into a semi-coma for two days, during which she's hastily married by her father to someone from their caste. Upon finding out, Arjun is devastated and creates chaos in both his and Preethi's house, and is kicked out by both.

With his talent, he gets immediately employed and rents an apartment. He then goes on a downward spiral and subsequently becomes an alcoholic and a drug addict. He continues to perform surgeries even though he is intoxicated and has a 100% success rate, with 245 surgeries in 200 days. 7 months after the wedding, despite Shiva's attempts, he's unable to forget Preethi. He convinces one of his young patients, a leading film star to have a no-strings relationship, but rejects that when she falls in love with him. One day, when he is on leave and high on drugs, the hospital head nurse begs him to attend to an emergency. Unwillingly he agress, but collapses during the surgery due to dehydration. Though he regains consciousness and under his supervision, the nurses save the patient, the Hospital chief files a medical criminal case on him.

Though Arjun's brother makes favorable case for him, he accepts blame during the hearing, which leads to him being banned from practicing any medicine for five years. He's also kicked out of his apartment the same day. He spends the night sleeping on the road with his dog, named Preethi. Shiva finds him the next day at a cafe and informs him that his grandmother has died. This sparks a change in him, and he goes back to his home, takes responsibility and consoles everyone, including his dad, and reconciles with his family. After being suggested by his father to take a vacation abroad, he agrees. On the way to the airport, he sees Preethi in a park, and she is pregnant. He's heartbroken, and decides on his trip to talk to her once he gets back.

He meets Preethi, and clears all misunderstandings with her. He also finds out that she's fled her home three days after her wedding, and didn't even allow her husband to touch her, and tells Arjun that the baby is his. They both are delighted and kiss and make up. They both get married and Preethi's father realizes his mistake, not knowing how pure their love was. The movie ends on a happy note.</p>
